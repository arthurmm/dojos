===Scoring===
In general, one point is scored for each pin that is knocked over. So if a player bowls over three pins with the first shot, then six with the second, the player would receive a total of nine points for that frame. If a player knocks down 9 pins with the first shot, but misses with the second, the player would also score nine. When a player fails to knock down all ten pins after their second ball it is known as an open frame.

In the event that all ten pins are knocked over by a player in a single [[frame]], bonuses are awarded.

*'''[[Strike (bowling)|strike]]''': When all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (called a strike and typically rendered as an “X” on a scoresheet), a player is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next two balls. In this way, the points scored for the two balls after the strike are counted twice.
::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
::Frame 2, ball 1: 3 pins
::Frame 2, ball 2: 6 pins
::'''The total score from these throws is: '''
:::*Frame one: 10 + (3 + 6) = 19
:::*Frame two: 3 + 6 = 9
::::'''TOTAL = 28'''

Two consecutive strikes are referred to as a “double.” (image unavailable)

A double's pinfall is:
::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
::Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
::Frame 3, ball 1: 9 pins
::Frame 3, ball 2: 0 pins (recorded as a dash '-' on the scoresheet)
:::The total score from these throws is:
::Frame one: 10 + (10 + 9) = 29
::Frame two: 10 + (9 + 0) = 19
::Frame three: 9 + 0 = 9
:::TOTAL = 57

Three strikes bowled consecutively are known as a “[[Turkey (bowling)|turkey]]” or “triple.” (image unavailable)

A triple's pinfall is:
::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
::Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
::Frame 3, ball 1: 10 pins (Strike)
::Frame 4, ball 1: 0 pins (Gutterball)
::Frame 4, ball 2: 9 pins
:::The total score from these throws is:
::Frame one: 10 + (10 + 10) = 30
::Frame two: 10 + (10 + 0) = 20
::Frame three: 10 + (0 + 9) = 19
::Frame four: 0 + 9 = 9
:::TOTAL = 78

Any longer string of strikes is referred to by a number attached to the word “bagger,” as in “five-bagger” for five consecutive strikes. Recently, the event of bowling four consecutive strikes has also been called a "ham bone.” This terminology is used most often when a bowler is “off the strikes.” (i.e. has previously bowled a string of several strikes but failed to strike on his most recent ball.) When a player is “on the strikes,” a string is often referenced by affixing “in a row” to the number of strikes bowled consecutively. Six strikes in a row are sometimes referred to as a “six pack.”<ref name="Bowling Lingo">{{cite web | title=Professional Bowlers Association: Randy's Rants: Bowling Lingo | year=2006 | author=Pederson, Randy | publisher=Professional Bowlers Association. | url=http://www.pba.com/resources/basics/bowlinglingo.asp | accessdate=2006-04-01}}</ref><ref name="Tenpin Glossary">{{cite web | title=Tenpin Bowling Dot Org: The Game » Glossary: Bowling Lingo | year=2006 | author=Michael | publisher=Tenpin Bowling Dot Org. | url=http://www.tenpinbowling.org/view.php?page=the_game.glossary | accessdate=2006-04-01}}</ref> Six strikes and nine strikes in a row can also be referred to “Wild Turkeys” and “Golden Turkeys” respectively. Any string of strikes starting in the first frame or ending “off the sheet” (where all of a bowler’s shots from a certain frame to the end of the game strike) are often referred to as the “front” or “back” strikes, respectively (e.g. the “front nine” for strikes in frames 1-9, or the “back six” for strikes in frames 7, 8, and 9 with a turkey in the tenth). A “Perfect Game” or 12 strikes in a row is also colloquially referred to as the “Thanksgiving Turkey.”

:A player who scores multiple strikes in succession would score like so:
::Frame 1, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
::Frame 2, ball 1: 10 pins (strike)
::Frame 3, ball 1: 4 pins
::Frame 3, ball 2: 2 pins
::'''The score from these throws are: '''
:::*Frame one: 10 + (10 + 4) = 24
:::*Frame two: 10 + (4 + 2) = 16
:::*Frame three: 4 + 2 = 6
::::'''TOTAL = 46'''

:The most points that can be scored in a single frame is '''30 points''' (10 for the original strike, plus strikes in the two subsequent frames).

:A player who bowls a strike in the tenth (final) frame is awarded two extra balls so as to allow the awarding of bonus points. If both these balls also result in strikes, a total of 30 points (10 + 10 + 10) is awarded for the frame.  These bonus points do not count on their own, however.  They only count as the bonus for the strike.
[[Image:Bowlspare.PNG|thumb|right|A ten-pin bowling scoresheet showing how a [[Spare (bowling)|spare]] is scored.]]
*'''[[Spare (bowling)|spare]]''': A “spare” is awarded when no pins are left standing after the second ball of a frame; i.e., a player uses both balls of a frame to clear all ten pins. A player achieving a spare is awarded ten points, plus a bonus of whatever is scored with the next ball (only the first ball is counted).  It is typically rendered as a slash on scoresheets in place of the second pin count for a frame.
:Example:
::Frame 1, ball 1: 7 pins
::Frame 1, ball 2: 3 pins (spare)
::Frame 2, ball 1: 4 pins
::Frame 2, ball 2: 2 pins
::'''The total score from these throws is: '''
:::*Frame one: 7 + 3 + 4 (bonus) = 14
:::*Frame two: 4 + 2 = 6
::::'''TOTAL = 20'''

A player who bowls a spare in the tenth (final) frame is awarded one extra ball to allow for the bonus points.

Correctly calculating bonus points can be difficult, especially when combinations of strikes and spares come in successive frames. In modern times, however, this has been overcome with automated scoring systems, linked to the machines that set and clear the pins between frames. A computer automatically counts pins that remain standing, and fills in a virtual score sheet (usually displayed on monitors above each lane). However, even the automated system is not fool-proof, as the computer can miscount the number of pins that remain standing.

The maximum score in a game of ten-pin is 300. On Feb. 2, 1997, University of Nebraska sophomore Jeremy Sonnenfeld became the first person ever to roll three perfect games of 300 in a three-game series (as approved by the American Bowling Congress).  This has only been achieved a handful of times since.

In [[UK|Britain]], the youngest bowler ever to achieve a perfect single game score of 300 (12 consecutive strikes), in a sanctioned competition was {{age in years and days|1993|10|28|2006|1|7}} old [[Elliot John Crosby]], at AMF Purley in South London, England in the Surrey County trials on January 7, 2006.<ref name="Bowler's Club">{{cite web |  date=January 14, 2006 | author=Bowler's Club 2005 Staff | publisher=Bowler's Club 2005 | url=http://raynesparkybc.tripod.com/Elliots300.htm|title=Elliot Crosby becomes the youngest player in the UK to shoot 300|accessdate=2006-04-12}}</ref> Crosby beat the previous British 300 shooter record holder Rhys Parfitt by more than a year. Parfitt was 13 years, 4 months when he achieved a 300 point game at the London international tenpin bowling tournament in 1994. In the [[United States]], the youngest ever bowler to achieve this in a sanctioned competition is two-handed bowler [[Chaz Dennis]] of [[Columbus, Ohio]]. He achieved this competing in the Hillcrest Preps-Juniors league at Hillcrest Lanes in Columbus, Ohio on December 16, 2006 at {{age in years and days|1996|9|19|2006|12|16}} old.
